# Bhok-Lagyo

# APP CREATED USING HTML, CSS & VANILLA JAVASCRIPT

# KEEP IN MIND THE FOLLOWING THINGS

  * It isn't responsive to different screen sizes. It was built on a 15.6" screen machine
  * After logging out, user can go back to their profile by just clicking the 'back' button on their browser. So Logout feature isn't TRULY implemented.
  * You can't un-wishlist the food items (neither by clicking again on wishlist icon nor by decreasing quantity of the item to less than 1 i.e. 0)
  * This app doesn't really save users' wishlisted food items, bookmarked recipes and created recipes in their own profile / account
  * At last, the code may not be perfectly organized üòÅ
